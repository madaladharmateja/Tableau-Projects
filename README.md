**Sample Super Store Dataset - VIZ:** The dashboard is a visualization of sales and profit data for a sample super store.

 The objective of the dashboard is to provide a quick and easy overview of the store's performance, and to help identify any areas where there may be problems.

** The dashboard is divided into several sections:**

**Region:** This section shows the total sales and profit for each region in the United States. The West region has the highest sales and profit, followed by the Northeast and the South. The Midwest has the lowest sales and profit.

**StateWise Sales:** This section shows the sales for each state in the United States. California has the highest sales, followed by Texas and New York. The District of Columbia has the lowest sales.

**Category-SubCategoryWise - Sales:** This section shows the sales for each category and subcategory of products. Technology is the highest-selling category, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies.

**Category-SubCategory-ProductWise - Sales:** This section shows the sales for each product within each category and subcategory. Chairs are the highest-selling product in the Furniture category, followed by Tables and Bookcases. Phones are the highest-selling product in the Office Supplies category, followed by Storage and Binders.

**Here are some additional insights that can be gleaned from the dashboard:**
