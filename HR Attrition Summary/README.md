**HR Attrition Dashboard**

**Objective:**
The objective of creating an HR dashboard  is to analyze and present a comprehensive summary of employee attrition within the organization. The dashboard aimed to provide insights into the factors contributing to attrition, identify patterns, and assist in making data-driven decisions to reduce attrition rates.

**Dataset Reference:** HR Attrition Dataset.xlsx

**Observations/ Insights:**

* Attrition Rate Analysis: The dashboard displayed the overall attrition rate within the organization. Insights include identifying departments or job roles with higher attrition rates, and enabling targeted retention strategies for those areas.

* Demographic Analysis: Analyzing attrition based on demographic factors such as age, gender,  or tenure might have revealed patterns. For instance, understanding if younger or older employees are more prone to attrition or if there's a specific education level linked to higher turnover rates.

* Engagement and Satisfaction Metrics: Analyzing employee engagement survey results or satisfaction scores alongside attrition rates could indicate the correlation between satisfaction levels and attrition.
