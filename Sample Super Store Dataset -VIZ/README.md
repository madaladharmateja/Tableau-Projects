**Observations / Insights:**

* The dashboard provides a overview of the performance of the sample super store. It is clear that the West region is the most 
  profitable, and that the Technology category is the highest-selling. However, there are also some areas of concern, such as the low 
  sales in the Midwest region and the District of Columbia.

* The store's sales are seasonal, with the highest sales in the summer months.

* The profits are also seasonal, but to a lesser extent than sales.

* Sales are growing over time.

* Profits are also growing over time, but at a slower rate than sales.
